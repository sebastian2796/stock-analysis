MODULE 2 CHALLENGE: VBA CODE MEASURES STOCK PERFORMANCE
Purpose of this analysis: Using a refractored code, our dataset will be sifted through at a faster pace than before so your coworker can use the buttons on Excel.  
Using for loops and arrays to organize and format the data in a very presentable way.  
The for loops we created will loop over all the rows in the activated spreadsheet
Some problems or hiccups that could arise from this challenge are the formatting, activating the correct worksheet, not nesting the for loop correctly, or even confusion between i and j and keep the consistency of them.
